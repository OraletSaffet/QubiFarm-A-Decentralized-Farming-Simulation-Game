## 1. Overview

**QubiFarm** is a mobile farming simulation game that integrates decentralized technologies to offer players true ownership of in-game assets. QubiFarm showcases a real world application of blockchain technology in a highly accessible gaming context, lowering the barrier to entry for non-crypto users while highlighting the power of decentralized systems. The game allows players to manage and grow a digital farm planting crops, raising animals, and trading goods while enabling true digital ownership, decentralized asset trading, and real world data-driven gameplay.

## 2. Scope of the proposal

Players grow crops, raise animals, and trade goods on a blockchain-powered marketplace, where every item is tokenized and player-owned. The game evolves with input from its community, making it more than just a farm — it’s a shared world built by the players, for the players. Designed to be lightweight, accessible, and fun, QubiFarm brings digital ownership to life in a familiar, relaxing game experience.

## 3. Technical Development

The technical development of QubiFarm will focus on building a performant, modular, and scalable mobile game integrated with Qubic’s decentralized infrastructure. The scope is broken into four primary phases, covering both the gameplay and blockchain components.

###  3.1 Mobile Game Core

- **Game Engine**: Developed using **Godot** (for 2D farming mechanics), optimized for Android, IOS and Web.
- **Gameplay Systems**:
  - Crop planting, harvesting, and timed growth cycles
  - Animal care and product generation
  - Resource systems (coins, inventory)
  - Farm building, decoration, and land expansion
- **UI/UX Design**: Touch-optimized, minimal interface for casual play and low-spec devices.


###  3.2 Decentralized Integration (Qubic)

- **Identity Layer**:
  - Integration with **Qubic’s digital identity** for secure login and cross-device continuity
- **Asset Ownership**:
  - Items (e.g., crops, tools, land) linked to player-controlled records using Qubic
- **Transparency & Data Persistence**:
  - Publicly verifiable player data (achievements, assets, etc.)
- **Player Marketplace**:
  - Listing, searching, and trading of in-game items using Qubic-powered infrastructure


###  3.3 Backend & Infrastructure

- **Lightweight Server Layer**:
  - Handles matchmaking, market syncing, and seasonal event data
- **Data Sync**:
  - Player progress saved across sessions via Qubic + optional cloud fallback
- **Analytics (Opt-in)**:
  - Telemetry for gameplay balancing and engagement analysis


###  3.4 DevOps & Testing

- **CI/CD Pipeline**:
  - Automated builds and deployment for Android and iOS
  - Beta testing distribution via Firebase or TestFlight
- **Testing Suite**:
  - Unit tests for gameplay
  - Integration tests for blockchain sync logic
  - QA testing through staged releases and player feedback

## 4. Features

- **Tokenized Assets:** Players have full ownership over the items they earn or create such as crops, tools, animals, and cosmetics. These assets are portable, tradeable, and tied to the player, creating long term engagement and new monetization opportunities through peer to peer exchange.
- **Decentralized Marketplace:** QubiFarm introduces a decentralized in-game economy where supply and demand are influenced by players, not controlled by the developer. This opens the door to real-value trading and sustainable in game commerce, increasing retention and lifetime player value.
- **Personalized Farm Building** Players are given tools to fully design and expand their farms, leading to emotional investment in their progress. Customization increases social sharing and creates potential for cosmetic-based revenue models.
- **Community Governance:** Players participate in decision-making processes, voting on game updates, events, and economic policies.
- **Cross-Platform Accessibility:** Designed primarily for mobile devices, ensuring broad accessibility and engagement.

## 5. Monetization Strategy

QubiFarm introduces a value-aligned monetization model based on digital ownership and real-world utility, using Qubic to tokenize in-game assets and enable direct player-to-player economic activity.


### 5.1 Tokenized In-Game Assets

  - All key in-game items (e.g., crops, tools, livestock, decorations) are tokenized and tied to the player’s identity on the Qubic protocol.
  - These tokens represent real ownership and can be exchanged or transferred between players.


### 5.2 Player-to-Player Trading with Real Value

  - QubiFarm features a decentralized marketplace where players can list and trade tokenized assets with others using Qubic-compatible tokens.
  - Pricing is set by supply, demand, and player preference — allowing an open economy powered by real-world value.


### 5.3 Crafting and Value Creation

  - Players who invest time and strategy into producing rare or high-demand items can earn real value by selling them on the in-game market.
  - This model promotes a play-to-own approach, where effort and creativity translate into tangible rewards.


### 5.4 Marketplace Transaction Fees

  - A small transaction fee is applied to marketplace trades.
  - This serves as the project’s main revenue source and sustains further development, infrastructure, and live support.


### 5.5 Optional Premium Content

  - Future expansions or exclusive cosmetic content may be offered as optional purchases using real value or Qubic-native tokens.
  - These offerings are designed to remain non-intrusive and preserve gameplay balance.


QubiFarm’s monetization model is built to empower players, not exploit them — prioritizing fair value exchange, digital ownership, and long-term engagement through a sustainable decentralized economy.
